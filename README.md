# Theano-learn
Repo to track my progress in learning Theano

### Why this repo exists
I wanna learn how to use [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) to 
do some cool machine learning. Starting off, I have a decent understanding of
python, no knowledge of numpy, and a pretty good grasp of basic machine
learning and the math associated with it...so this will be a fun journey!

### Goals to accomplish (in rough chronological order)
* logistic regression
* Basic feedforward neural network
* Convolutional neural network
* Recurrent neural network
* LSTM (yikes)

### Planned projects/applications:
* Drug response prediction from microarray data
* Speech recognition
* Theorem 2 classification project ;)
